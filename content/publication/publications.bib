  abstract = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly, these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here, we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

  abstract = {Genomic simulations are an important technique used in population genetics to infer demographic history, test for regions under selection, and create datasets to validate software. However, running thousands of simulations and manipulating large loci can present computational challenges. We present SimPrily, a Python tool optimized for high throughput computing (HTC), which facilitates simulation of whole chromosomes. SimPrily can use prior distributions of parameters to run simulations, incorporate single nucleotide polymorphism array ascertainment bias into the simulated model, and calculate a variety of genomic summary statistics. We include with SimPrily high-throughput workflows that leverage free computing resources through the Open Science Grid and CyVerse Discovery Environment, allowing researchers to run thousands or millions of large-locus simulations with minimal or no prior command line knowledge.},
