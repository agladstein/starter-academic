abstract: The Ashkenazim are awell-studied populationwith a dynamic and unique history.
  The spread of Jew- ish populations from the Middle East to locations in the Diaspora
  in the past 2000 years repre- sents a microcosm of the evolutionary processes affecting
  modern humans as they dispersed out of Africa (e.g. founder effects, migrations,
  admix- ture and adaptation). Ashkenazim – Jews who trace their ancestry to founders
  who moved to the Rhine Valley in the fourth century – are no exception. Recent studies
  both support and refute long-standing hypotheses of Ashkenazi origins. Together,
  the results Strengthen the inferences that Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to
  a genet- ically diverse population in the Middle East that underwent a series of
  founder events – reducing genetic diversity relative to the ancestral population
  – and that subsequently experienced significant gene flow during the period of Ashkenazi
  residency in Europe.
