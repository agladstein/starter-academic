abstract: The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes
  of analysis, and increasingly, these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations.
  Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate
  large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation
  engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers
  currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency
  and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical
  researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or
  sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks
  standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here, we
  describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim
  is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing
  catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple
  simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python
  library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating
  how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods,
  and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing
  resource.
