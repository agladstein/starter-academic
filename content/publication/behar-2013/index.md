abstract: 'The origin and history of the Ashkenazi Jewish population have long been
  of great interest, and advances in high-throughput genetic analysis have recently
  provided a new approach for investigating these topics. We and others have argued
  on the basis of genome-wide data that the Ashkenazi Jewish population derives its
  ancestry from a combination of sources tracing to both Europe and the Middle East.
  It has been claimed, however, through a reanalysis of some of our data, that a large
  part of the ancestry of the Ashkenazi population originates with the Khazars, a
  Turkic-speaking group that lived to the north of the Caucasus region Ìƒ1,000 years
  ago. Because the Khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could
  enable a clear test for a contribution to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, the Khazar
  hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics. Furthermore, because only
  limited genetic data have been available from the Caucasus region, and because these
  data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations
  from the Middle East, the attribution of any signal of Ashkenazi-Caucasus genetic
  similarity to Khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral Middle Eastern ancestry
  has been problematic. Here, through integration of genotypes from newly collected
  samples with data from several of our past studies, we have assembled the largest
  data set available to date for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins. This
  data set contains genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,774 samples from
  106 Jewish and non-Jewish populations that span the possible regions of potential
  Ashkenazi ancestry: Europe, the Middle East, and the region historically associated
  with the Khazar Khaganate. The data set includes 261 samples from 15 populations
  from the Caucasus region and the region directly to its north, samples that have
  not previously been included alongside Ashkenazi Jewish samples in genomic studies.
  Employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population-genetic
  structure, we found that Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with
  other Jewish populations and, among non-Jewish populations, with groups from Europe
  and the Middle East. No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews to populations from
  the Caucasus is evident, particularly populations that most closely represent the
  Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from
  the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi
  Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe,
  that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and
  that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within
  or from north of the Caucasus region.'
