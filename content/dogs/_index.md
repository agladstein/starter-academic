I adopted Naomi as 5 month old puppy in 2010 from the Washington Animal Rescue League, in Washington DC. 
Naomi is a perfect Rottweiler mix, who enjoys laying in the sun and pleasing her humans. 
I adopted Teo as a 3 month old puppy in 2014 from the Pima County Animal Shelter, in Tucson, AZ. 
Teo is an unknown mix (Rhodesian Ridgeback?), who enjoys barking at squirrels and counter-surfing.
