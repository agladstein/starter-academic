I started figure skating when I was 9 years old and continued through college.
During graduate school in Tucson, AZ there was no ice rink, so I started circus arts.
Since starting my postdoctoral position in Chapel Hill, NC, I've started figure skating again
and am continuing with circus arts. If you're interested learning more about my movement history,
see below to learn about my skills, training, teaching, and performance experiences.
