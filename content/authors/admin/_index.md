I am a postdoctoral researcher in Genetics with [Daniel Schrider](https://www.schriderlab.org/).
I am interested in using genomic data to learn about evolutionary history, 
and have focused my work on recent demographic history of populations. 
I enjoy tackling large computational problems in order to answer biological questions.

When I'm not working in the lab, I like to play with my two dogs, and train in circus arts and figure skating.
